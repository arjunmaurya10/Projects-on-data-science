Road accidents represent a significant public health concern worldwide. 
Understanding the factors that influence survival outcomes can help inform safety policies, vehicle design improvements, and emergency response protocols.

This analysis explores the Road Accident Survival Dataset to identify key demographic, behavioral, and situational factors that impact the probability of surviving a road accident. 
Our goal is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates survival probability based on these factors and extract actionable insights to improve road safety.

We will focus on the relationship between age, gender, speed of impact, safety device usage, and survival outcomes, creating both descriptive insights and predictive models.
